  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>We started the lesson with advice given to us about developing our Thimble Websites further. This advice was updated as the lesson continued.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To improve our websites, and experiment with elements such as padding, div's, id’s, and more.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes. My website has improved even more than last week, and I have a greater understanding of new factors on Thimble, meaning I can make even further progress in future weeks.</td>
  </tr>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>Perseverance was still used this week, however less so than in previous lessons. This was mainly due to the fact that I didn't come across as many issues as usual. I worked with the code far more easily, and problems were not as common. However, in the "Experimentation Section" which I made, I came across a few issues when trying to add an image. This involved perseverance to complete the task.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>To start with, I began adding images to my blogs. However, this didn’t seem to make the blog look any better. (In future weeks I will attempt to incorporate images within blogs.) It took questioning to work out the best way to involve experimenting with my website, without ruining the blogs I had already uploaded. And so, I created the “Experimentation Page”</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>Independence was maintained throughout all of this week. Despite asking the teacher a few questions on a some issues, I kept to myself with my work. This is because everyone’s website is at a different stage, and so collaboration was not needed.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I have reflected on this week and concluded that I need to work more with including images to my design. I know it is possible for the website to become even more aesthetically-pleasing with images, but first I need to work on using factors such as padding, and researching further into colour schemes for this to work.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I continued to remain engaged in the lesson, however i could’ve achieved more if I was slightly more concentrated in the later stages. More work at a faster pace would have helped me achieve my full potential.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could have incorporated images with text more effectively. Although I added images to the website, and started using the "Float" tool as well, I didn't experiment with combining images with text enough. This is essential for images to work with blogs, and so I must work on that in future weeks.
Not only this, but I seemed to slow down at the end of the lesson. My work ethic decreased, meaning I ended the lesson with a website that was not finished. If I had kept working as hard throughout the whole lesson, more time could be available in future lessons to experiment more.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I need to change how often I use valuable resources. With features such as W3 Schools, as well as the instructions on the school website, I did not use them to my advantage as much as I could have done. Although there is importance in trying to work issues out for myself, there is also nothing wrong with using resources available to me so that I can work with Thimble as successfully as possible. 
Also, next time, I must not turn to asking a friend or the teacher at the first sign of a problem. Instead, I need to work issues out for myself. Whilst this process can be frustrating, and extremely time-consuming, it is vital I experience the process for the benefit of my learning. </td>
