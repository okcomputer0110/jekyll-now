    <td>Starting point:</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To understand the concept of an Ascii Table, and eventually make one of our own.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes. This lesson went far more successfully than the previous weeks so far. I reached my target and helped others also.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I spent a lot of time in the first half of the lesson setting up my spreadsheet, until realising that I was approaching the task incorrectly. It took perseverance to try again and again (and again) and find out how to finish my Ascii table. This process, however, was much quicker than week 3.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I found myself discussing the task with those sitting around me, and questioning their methods and advice to complete the table. I also made huge progress when questioning whether I was making the lesson seem more complicated than it needed to be. It turns out the way to finish the table was actually extremely simple. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>As with the other weeks so far this year, a large proportion of the hour involved collaboration with other students. In previous weeks, I ended up spending not enough time being independent. However, today was different. Discussion and collaboration helped my understanding, but it was independence that helped me complete the task.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I have reflected on this week and concluded that, whilst it has been my most successful lesson yet, there is still improvement to be made on the way I worked. What I will take away from this week is to continue not over-complicating tasks. However, in this lesson, I could've gone further and created an extra "hex" column. I will try to push myself further next week.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>Unlike last week, I did not lose engagement after finishing the task (however this was mainly because I finished the task nearer the end of the lesson). I succeeded to show engagement throughout and will continue with this for next lesson.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I could have applied a more methodical approach to creating my Ascii table. This would've saved more time, and meant I could’ve gone further afterwards. Also, I should’ve simplified the task more. I’d say around 90% of this lesson was purely based on week 3’s methods. Trying to discover new ways to finish a task was foolish when the answer could already have been solved in my code from week 3. Something else that could’ve gone better in my learning is my discussion with others on the task. Those around me suggested methods that were far more complicated than I am used to. And so, because of this I did not ask them enough of what they were talking about. This meant I became more confused and slowed me down as a result.</td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I must change the way I begin a lesson. I have recently realised that it is best to start a task independently first, and then collaborate with others later. However, today, I had a discussion with my classmates about the task first, instead of giving it a go for myself. This did not actually help me, but instead made me think the task was more complicated than it needed to be. 
Secondly, I will change the doubt I had in my original decisions. Due to the fact I did not trust my first intentions meant the task took longer than it needed to be. After working for a long time in the lesson, the way I created my Ascii table came back to what I had thought originally.</td>
