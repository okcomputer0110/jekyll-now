  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>We started the lesson with an introduction to a new programming software called "Thimble". Detailed instructions were provided on the school website, and we worked off that.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To create a new well-written website with “Thimble”, ready for next week.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes. I found working with new software challenging, but fun. The school website helped me massively, from which I could understand the basics of “Thimble”.</td>
  </tr>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>My understanding of what to do was extremely unclear to start with. Although the instructions on the school website made things as easy as possible, I still found it tricky since I was so used to Github. It took perseverance to finally create a website that I was proud of. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>Questioning was not used as much as on other weeks in this lesson. This was mainly due to the fact that Thimble happens to be an extremely simple way to code. The full-proof instructions made the situation simple, with little questioning needed.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>Independence was consistent throughout this week. Unlike other weeks this year, those in my class all had different targets to me. I had a clear idea of what I wanted my website to look like, meaning that collaboration was unnecessary. However, at times, I may have asked someone about a question I had over Thimble. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I have reflected on this week and concluded that just because a task may be new, does not mean it is in any way more difficult. At first, I did not like the change from Github to Thimble. However, after significant progress, I know that Thimble is an easier way to make a website.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I remained engaged at school, and at home when working on this task. Trying something new requires concentration, and so maintaining this helped me to create the website I wanted. I also found that I tried different methods with my coding, meaning I wasn't wasting time doing the same thing and expecting a different outcome.</td>

    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could have ignored Github more. This does not mean forgetting Github completely, as there are many similarities to the code on that, compared to the code on Thimble. But constantly, my mindset was thinking back to coding in Github. Whilst GIthub is similar to Thimble, they are not the same. Github involves variables, meaning Thimble requires a slightly different approach to making a website. What also could have gone better in my learning was otherthinking the instructions provided on the school website. Naturally, I assumed the task should have been much harder than it was. This meant the extremely simple commands on the School Website were not followed accurately enough. This held me back and wasted a huge amount of time.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I need to change the pace I work at. In the lesson, due to various distractions around me, whether that be people or difficulties in code, I became used to a slow pace. This continued at home, meaning I was not performing as well or as fast as I could've done.
Also, I must try to change my habit of asking unnecessary questions. Many times during the lesson I asked students around me of something I needed to do. But the answers were something I could’ve worked out on my own anyway. This was a waste of both mine and their time.</td>
